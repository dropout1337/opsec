# The OPSEC Guide Book
- In this I will go over the key components in maintaining good opsec.

## Picking an alias
- This isn't an xbox or ps4 we're dealing with no ties to personal life, everything stays unique and random.

## VPNs
- Lets start with ditching everything you know about VPNs, we don't want any paid services like mullvad.
- Start with ordering a server from Switzerland/Netherland, etc..
- Setup your own VPN you could use something like OpenVPN.

## Emails
- Emails is a big vector when it comes to exposing your identity. E.g pompompurin..
- Once again order a server from Swizterland/Netherland.
- Then setup a mail server, like roundcube or mailinabox.
- When naming your email use your alias only, don't spice in any numbers or anything else. Even possibly just use a random set of numbers and letters.
- The domain TLD matters here as well, if you're under investigation from a 3 letter agency there is a chance they'll attempt to take over your domain, therefor they could start seeing incoming mail. So we'd want a country TLD, something more annoying for the agency to seize in the first place.

## Purchases
- Keep everything crypto, no exceptions when a site only takes credit cards etc.
- When buying crypto use a non-KYC exchange service or *borrow* an ID.

## Operating Systems
- Now this does not matter, people see linux and such as the "hacker" and "secure" OS, but it highly depends on your situation and what you're using your PC for.
- If you're under investigation or paranoid a linux based distro would suit you well, something like tails or arch/ubuntu with a USB kill switch is quite useful.

## Friends And Relationships
- This is more important than you think, the people you surround yourself with can all be liabilities.
- In short be careful who you make connections with and what they know.
